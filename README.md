# General_List
In this repository you will find code in C++ for all the operations  in sorted and unsorted list.

Insert and delete in beginning, end or given location. Print Array list. Empty the Array list.

The main function is written in such a way using if and while that it calls the function of delete, insert etc by just typing the name of command.

You just need to have C++ compiler and have the '.h' and '.cpp' file saved in same folder.

Feel free to contact me if you find any error or a scope for improvement.

Happy Coding
